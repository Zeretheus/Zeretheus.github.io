           <h1>IS THE RESPONSE ENOUGH?</h1>
           <h6>by Gin Luther</h6>
           <p>Some people believe that our government’s response to the pandemic is one of the best in the world. It can be compared to that of New Zealand’s and Vietnam’s response. Nine out of ten Filipinos approve of the government response on COVID-19. Statistics from Pulse Asia has proven this belief; however, the responses are from Duterte’s fanatics. These fanatics are the people who disagree with the rallies of affected people because they reason, “Dagdag pa sa COVID cases yan” but they are the same people who flock to the white sand beach of Manila Bay. The presence of these smart people makes the government think that their response is the best, but reality proves otherwise. When the pandemic started to spread across the globe, the government refused to restrict Chinese people from entering the country. “We do not want to hurt the feelings of our Chinese friends.”, as if they are more important than the welfare of the country’s citizens. When the first case emerged, the longest and strictest lockdown in the entire globe has begun. People celebrating as classes and work was cancelled, businesses rejoicing as they do not have to open, and the government officials chilling even after the first case was confirmed. As days and weeks and even months dragged by, the government has still no concrete plans to eradicate the virus, but they have the greatest plans to divert the attention of the gullible citizens of our country. The government started to formulate these incredible ideas when they cannot answer the questions and pacify the requests of the government’s critics. They think of these plans so carefully, but they cannot think when it comes to COVID-19, as if their brains start malfunctioning at the mention of the pandemic. These plans are so well-planned that they outshine the current problems of the country. It started with small diversions, such as Debold Sinas’ mananita party, then carried on to the most orchestrated performance in the twenty-first century. The performance started when the government did everything in its power to shut down ABS-CBN. The next act is when the Philhealth issue emerged. Many of the current officials have been told to resign, except for the great Duque, who was given a “stern warning” only. Duque then proceedes to tour the Philippines as if he is the secretary of the Department of Tourism, who is probably doing nothing as the department is not essential currently. He is currently prioritizing to distribute face masks to the people. The Department of Health also has time to create a play on how to combat the disease, as if swords can pierce viruses. The act ends and Harry Roque’s side performance starts. His statements are very relevant to the government’s actions, and it seems that he is trying his best to protect the fragile ego of the government officials. He also has a part-time job as Duque’s assistant in touring the country and promoting Boracay. The next act starts in probably the most elegant, shocking, crème de la crème rehabilitation of Philippine history, the infamous Manila Bay white sand beach. The project only costs 389 million and covers most of the Manila Bay area. This is the most important project of the government amid the pandemic. This is the solution to the mental health problems of Filipinos, and the sand can cure COVID if it is rubbed in the skin. Apparently, the government’s supporters are immune to the policy that prohibits mass gathering as no efforts to maintain physical distancing in the beach was seen. Of course, the performance cannot be possible without the help of loyal supporters. They call themselves DDS, short for Duterte’s Diehard Supporters. These warriors, majority of them resides in Facebook, support the government’s plans, and criticizes the critics of the government. They find every critic of the government and shower them with their one-liners, the most famous being,” Ba’t hindi nalang ikaw magpresidente?” We should not dare to criticize the governent, as they are doing their best to combat the pandemic. We only have a few thousand cases, compared to the COVID hotspot of the world with a few million cases only. We also have the best testing capacity in Southeast Asia, surpassing that of Thailand and Vietnam. We should also try to support the efforts of the government, especially our president’s. He is so tired and sleep-deprived from trying to think of possible solutions. We should shield him from the critics who have done nothing but bash the government. The best solution for our problems is obviously the white sand beach of Manila bay. It has healing properties greater than the most powerful antibiotics or treatments available worldwide. It can heal the mental diseases that are riddling the people and can help them ascend to a higher thinking. The second-best solution is simply do nothing. Doing nothing can solve a problem, as the solution will just come naturally. It can be compared to that of the white sand’s properties, but only less effective. As most of the world starts to move on with the pandemic and enter the new normal. The Philippines, along with some countries, are still trying to eradicate the virus for good. Even though the government tries to stop the spread, it fails miserably. The Philippines has introduced the virus to countries with no cases or reintroduce the virus to countries that have already killed it. Even with these conditions, the government tries to open the economy. Yes, the economy should be opened but how can we be sure that it will be safe? We cannot eradicate the virus when we have these kinds of leaders who focus on what they think is the best for our country and not what the experts say. These officials have led us to this situation and should be the ones to help us escape this hell. But how can we do it if the officials are clueless on how to properly combat the virus? Even our president does not know how to disinfect a face mask properly. “Use gasoline”, he says. He cannot entertain the critics of his administration. Even the vice president has no escape when he starts to throw a tantrum once he hears a single criticism. “Spray insectide in Metro Manila to kill the virus”, he says. The government has only one working plan, and that is to wait for the vaccine to come.</p>
